# Logistic Regression: Telecommunication Customer Churn #
This is an exercise for a Master of Science at WGU: D208 Predictive Modeling & Analytics.


<br> This code describes how a Logistic Model works. It compare two logistic models, where one contains 25 independent variables and the other with only 12 variables. 
This shows that logistic regression models work well with large sets of independent variables and the target variable must be binary.</br>
