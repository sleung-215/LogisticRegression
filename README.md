# Logistic Regression: Telecommunication Customer Churn #
This is an exercise for a Master of Science at WGU: D208 Predictive Modeling & Analytics.

<br> This code describes how a Logistic Model works. It compare two logistic models, where one contains 25 independent variables and the other with only 12 variables. 
This shows that logistic regression models work well with large sets of independent variables and the target variable must be binary.</br>

<br><b>OBJECTIVE</b></br>
Companies have a critical focus on customer relationship management because it directly impacts the company’s long-term profitability and the amount of costs that accrues when customers stop the business relationship. Customer attrition, also known as churn, is a metric that determines the rate in which a customer chooses to stop a relationship with a business. Customer churn is an important metric companies invest in because it researches and helps leaders of the company understand the underlying reasons why consumers choose to leave for a competitor.

In this research process, a dataset of 10,000 customer profiles have been obtained to acquire insights related to customer churn and to build a predictive model to select features that correlate to churn. The proposed research question in this analysis is:

<b>What characteristics in the customer’s profile correlates to their churn?</b>

This is the goal of this study because understanding a customer’s point of view can help the organization learn what are the underlying causes for customers to terminate their business relationship with the company. Concurrently, it also helps the organization understand what are the attractive aspects that make a customer stay. Knowing this information can help a company improve on certain services for their customer, while maintaining the quality of service that has aided customer retention.
